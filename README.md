# **Frontend Technical Challenge**

Welcome to our Frontend Technical Interview Challenge!  
The goal of this challenge is to assess your frontend development skills through building and enhancing a product listing application. We aim to evaluate how you approach problems, communicate your ideas, and work through frontend-related tasks.

---

## **How It Works**

### **1. Pre-Interview Preparation**
- You will receive access to a GitHub repository ahead of the interview.
- Take your time to explore the codebase and familiarize yourself with its structure and functionality.
- **Set up the project locally** by following the provided instructions to ensure it is ready to run during the interview. This preparation will help you save time and focus on the tasks during the session.

### **2. During the Interview**
- You will be presented with a set of tasks based on the repository you reviewed.
- These tasks will cover various aspects of frontend development, such as:
    - UI implementation
    - State management
    - API integration
    - Debugging
    - Testing

### **3. Collaboration and Guidance**
- You are **not expected to complete all tasks.**
- Our team will provide context, answer your questions, and support you throughout the session.
- Think of this as a **collaborative problem-solving experience** rather than a test.

---

## **What We Evaluate**
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: How you approach and reason through tasks.
- **Communication Skills**: Your ability to explain your thought process clearly.
- **Technical Knowledge**: Your comfort level with frontend concepts and tools.
- **Learning Mindset**: Your openness to learning and receiving feedback.

## **Project Description**

### **Product List Application**
This project is an Angular-based application that displays a list of products.  
It includes features such as listing products and adding new products through a modal form. The project is structured with various components, services, and modules to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **TypeScript**
- **Angular** (version 18)
- **Jest**
- **HTML**
- **SCSS/CSS**

---

## **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js and npm installed:** Download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Project Setup:** Clone the repository, install the dependencies, and ensure the project runs locally.

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

4. **Open the application in your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser to see the application running.

## Project Structure

- `components/`: Contains sub-components like product list and product list settings.
- `directives/`: Contains custom directives used in the application.
- `injectors/`: Contains injectors used in the application.
- `interfaces/`: Contains TypeScript interfaces used in the project.
- `modules/`: Contains modules like the product manual modal module.
- `pages/`: Contains the pages of the application like the product list page.
- `pipes/`: Contains custom pipes used in the application.
- `services/`: Contains services used throughout the application.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions used in the application.

---

## Running Tests

To run the tests for the project, use the following command:
```sh
npm run test
```

---

## Additional Information

- **Component-Based Structure:** The application is built using Angular components, promoting encapsulation and reusability.
- **Change Detection Strategy:** The project uses `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for better performance.
- **Standalone Components:** The project leverages Angular's standalone components feature for modularity.
- **TypeScript Interfaces:** Interfaces are used to define the shape of data models, ensuring type safety.
- **Unit Testing:** The project uses Jest for unit testing to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **Dependency Injection:** Angular's dependency injection is used to manage service instances and promote loose coupling.
- **Reactive Programming:** RxJS is used for handling asynchronous operations and managing state changes.
- **SCSS for Styling:** SCSS is used for styling components, allowing for nested rules and variables.
- **Linting and Formatting:** Tools like ESLint and Prettier are used to maintain code quality and consistency.

We are excited to see how you approach this challenge. Remember, we're here to support you throughout the process â€” good luck!
